# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: a function is like a factory with a set of instructions to execute. It will execute those instructions/calculation on data and it will output the result. We use functions to perform the same action multiple times within a script without having to repeat a lot of code.

  Researched answer: a funciton is like a procedure with a set of statements. The function takes in data and do something with that data like calculte a value of perform a task. We use functions to perform the same action multiple times within a script without having to repeat a lot of code.



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: When you declare a function, we use parameters as placeholders for the data that we will pass in to the function. The actual data that we pass in once we invoke/call the function is called an argument. -- This is silly but it helps me remember -> When we call, we call to argue! 

  Researched answer: When we define the function, we list variable as placeholders whithin the parentesis in the function. When we make the function call we pass in the arguments that the function will use to calculate and output the results. 



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: the index represends the position of an element in an array or the position of a character in a string. The value is the actual element that takes that specific position in the array or the string character that takes that specific position in the array. 

  Researched answer: the index of first character in a string or first characters in an array will be 0. The last element will be the length - 1. the index represends the position of an element in an array or the position of a character in a string. The value is the actual element that takes that specific position in the array or the string character that takes that specific position in the array. 


4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: a predefined function that solves a specific problem in a simpler way. It gives the user another level of abstraction serving as a tool better perform a task. 

  Researched answer: a small piece of functionality that helps the user of the lenguage to perform a specific task. It gives the programmer a level of abstraction in which he does not need to know the specifics on how the method is perfoming the task.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: One is the Driver - in charge of writing out the code - hands on keyboard and mouse. Following instructions.
  The other is the navigator - in charge of communicating their ideas to the driver. Doing most of the thinking. Giving instructions to the driver.

  Researched answer: Driver and Navigator. The driver has the hands on the keyboard and mouse. Follow instructions given by the navigator. !! Remember to switch roler every so ofter (recommended every 25 minutes)



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Definetly the pair programming apprach to takle the challenges. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: allow you to perform repetitive tasks

2. Higher Order Functions: These are functions that takes another function as an argument. You can pass in other functions into higher order functions.

3. Jest: it a javascript framework used for testing. The framework is maintained by facebook.

4. Classes: are objects blueprints (like a cookiecutter). Classes allow us to encapsulate the code within the object for better organization. Encapsulation is one of the 4 pillars in Object oriented program (OOP - a programing paradigm)

5. React: is a javascript library maintained by Facebook. This library comes with a bunch of built in methods and tools that will assist the users on building interactive User Interfaces.
